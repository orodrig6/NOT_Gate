CMOS inverter schematic/layout simulation results. 
DRC stands for "Design-Rule Check" this process is necessary before doing a layout vs schematic comparison to ensure you have followed proper layout guidelines. The only errors present are density errors which are acceptable because we are only doing a small single block design for all of the cadence layouts done.
